## About the project

This website was made for the "Forms and Deployment" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

This project is meant to showcase the NodeJS skills learned so far, mainly:

- Use the Express Application Generator tool to create a skeleton website and application.
- Start and stop the Node web server.
- Use a database (MongoDB with Mongoose) to store the application's data.
- Create routes for requesting different information, and templates to render the data as HTML.
- Work with forms.
- Deploy the application to production.

The page was made following [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) course, but instead of using Pug I used EJS.
